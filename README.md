# Explanation of the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Template

## Executive Summary

A **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** is a systematic process used by Canadian federal government institutions to identify, assess, and mitigate privacy risks associated with new or modified programs and activities that handle personal information. Its necessity is rooted in the *Privacy Act* and related Treasury Board (TBS) policies, which mandate that institutions be accountable for the protection of citizens' personal data.

The **primary goal of this template** is to provide a standardized framework for conducting a PIA. It ensures that all required aspects of privacy analysis are considered, facilitates a consistent approach across government, and creates a formal record for review and approval by privacy officials. Ultimately, it helps build privacy protections into the design of a program from the start, a "privacy by design" approach.

## Section by Section Breakdown

### Section A: Program or Activity Information
- **Purpose:** To establish the basic context of the initiative requiring the PIA.
- **Key Questions Answered:** What is the program? Which institution is responsible? Who is accountable? What are the program's description and scope?
- **Why it's important:** This section sets the stage. Without a clear understanding of the program's purpose and boundaries, an accurate assessment of its privacy implications is impossible.

### Section B: Notification and Personal Information
- **Purpose:** To document the foundational elements of how personal information is handled and the legal basis for doing so. This section requires close collaboration with your ATIP (Access to Information and Privacy) or Privacy Office.
- **Key Questions Answered:** What is the legal authority to collect information? Are the necessary Personal Information Banks (PIBs) established? How exactly is personal information collected, used, disclosed, stored, and disposed of? (This is detailed in a comprehensive table).
- **Why it's important:** This is the core of "what" you are doing with personal information. It ensures the program has a legal foundation and forces a detailed, end to end mapping of the data lifecycle.

### Section C: Privacy Analysis
- **Purpose:** To conduct a thorough self assessment against the 10 fair information principles outlined in the *Privacy Act*. This is the risk identification phase.
- **Key Questions Answered:** The section is organized by principle (e.g., Limiting Collection, Safeguards, Accuracy). For each, it asks a series of "Yes/No/Not Applicable" questions to determine if the program's practices are compliant and privacy protective.
- **Why it's important:** This structured questioning uncovers potential privacy risks and compliance gaps. It transforms the high level principles into practical, actionable items for the program team to consider.

### Section D: Risk Mitigation and Compliance Issue Action Plan
- **Purpose:** To develop a plan to address the risks and issues identified in Section C.
- **Key Questions Answered:** For each identified risk or compliance issue, what will we do to fix it? Who is responsible? By when?
- **Why it's important:** A PIA is not just an identification tool; it is a management tool. This section ensures that risks are not just noted but are actively managed and resolved, leading to a more robust and compliant program.

### Section E: Formal Approvals
- **Purpose:** To provide formal sign off, indicating accountability and acceptance of the PIA and its associated risk plans.
- **Key Questions Answered:** The program lead signs to commit to implementing the program as described and mitigating the risks. The institution's head (or delegate) signs under section 10 of the *Privacy Act*, approving the assessment itself.
- **Why it's important:** This formalizes the process and establishes clear accountability, ensuring senior management is aware of and accepts the privacy implications of the program.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

**Personal Information Bank (PIB):** A description of all personal information under the control of a government institution that is organized and retrievable by an individual's name or identifier. Programs must have a PIB that accurately reflects what data they collect and why. (Referenced in Sections B.2 and B.3).

**ATIP Office:** The Access to Information and Privacy Office within a government institution. This office is the central authority for privacy expertise and must be engaged throughout the PIA process. (Referenced in Section B header).

**Consistent Use:** A use of personal information that has a reasonable and direct connection to the original purpose for which the information was collected. For example, if personal information is collected to administer a grant (the primary purpose), using that same information to send a voluntary satisfaction survey later would be a 'consistent use' and must be identified. (Referenced in Section B.4 table and C.3).

**Subsection 8(2) of the *Privacy Act*:** This section outlines the specific circumstances under which a government institution can disclose personal information without an individual's consent (e.g., for law enforcement, to members of Parliament). If information is collected indirectly without consent, it often relies on an authority from subsection 8(2). (Referenced in Section C.2).

**Authority to Operate (ATO):** A formal approval granted by a senior official after a review determines that an information system's security controls are adequate to protect the information it handles. (Referenced in Section C.7).

## Process Flow for Completing the PIA

1. **Initiation (Section A):** The program area fills out the basic information about the program or activity.

2. **Data Mapping (Section B):** The program area, with help from the ATIP Office, maps the flow of personal information and identifies legal authorities and PIBs.

3. **Self Assessment (Section C):** The program area answers all the questions in the privacy analysis section. This often requires consulting with other stakeholders (IT security, legal, contractors).

4. **ATIP Office Review:** The draft PIA (Sections A C) is sent to the ATIP Office for review. They will ask questions, request documentation, and help identify risks.

5. **Risk Mitigation Planning (Section D):** The program area and the ATIP Office collaborate to develop the action plan to address the identified risks and compliance issues.

6. **Finalization and Sign Off (Section E):** The completed PIA, including the action plan, is formally signed by the program executive and the section 10 delegate.

## Common Challenges and Risk Areas

Based on the template's detailed questions, programs often face difficulties in these areas:

- **Third Party Data Handling (C.1 & C.4):** Ensuring that private sector contractors or other jurisdictions who handle personal information have adequate privacy and security safeguards in place, as required by binding agreements (e.g., contracts).

- **Demonstrating "Need to Know" (C.3):** Clearly justifying and documenting why specific employees or systems need access to specific pieces of personal information, and ensuring access is restricted accordingly.

- **Data Accuracy and Correction (C.6):** Implementing practical processes to ensure data is accurate and up to date, and establishing clear procedures for individuals to request corrections.

- **Adequate Safeguards (C.7):** This is a broad area that includes ensuring security assessments (ATOs) are completed, access is logged and monitored, and a robust breach response plan is in place.

- **Indirect Collection (C.2):** Properly justifying the collection of personal information from a source other than the individual (e.g., another government department) and ensuring the proper legal authority exists for such collection.

- **Defining "Consistent Uses" (C.3):** Correctly identifying all secondary uses of the data that are directly related to the original purpose, which can sometimes be open to interpretation.
